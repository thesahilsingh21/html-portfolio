<h1> THE BEST ANIME ACCORDING TO SAHIL </h1>
<h2> My top 3 favorite anime of all time </h2>

<hr />

<h3> 1. NARUTO SHIPPUDEN </h3>
<p>I used to watch this a lot in my childhood</p>
<h3>2. DRAGON BALL Z</h3>
<p>One of the Big 3s</p>
<h3>3. BAKI HANMA</h3>
<p>Because I am a combat sports practitioner,
     this anime is the reason for my quest of 
     strength and power, I joined gym beacause I was inspired by the characters and their mentality about strength and masculinity</p>
